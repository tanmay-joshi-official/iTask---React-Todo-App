# ✅ iTask – React Todo App

iTask is a responsive and user-friendly Todo App built using React.  
It allows users to manage daily tasks with add, edit, delete, and complete features while keeping data saved in localStorage.

This project focuses on real-world functionality, clean UI, and proper state handling in React.

# 📌 Project Overview

iTask helps users keep track of their daily tasks in a simple and effective way.  
The goal of this project was to practice React fundamentals by building a real working CRUD app.

Users can:
- Add tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Keep their data saved even after refreshing

The app is designed to stay minimal and distraction-free while still being functional.

# 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** – useState, useEffect, useRef  
- **JavaScript** – map, filter, findIndex  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Flexbox, responsive layout  
- **UUID** – Unique ID generation  
- **React Icons** – Edit & delete icons  
- **LocalStorage** – Persisting todos data

# ⚙️ How It Works

- Todo text is stored using useState  
- Todo list is managed as an array of objects  
- Each todo has id, text, and completion status  
- useEffect loads todos from localStorage on first render  
- Another useEffect saves todos whenever list updates  
- useRef prevents overwriting localStorage on first render  
- Array methods handle edit, delete, and toggle logic  
- Tailwind handles layout and responsiveness
